Step 1 Understand the Project Requirements
API Structure
Familiarize yourself with the API you will be working with, focusing on its four parts artists, locations, dates, and relations.
Understand what data each part contains and how they relate to each other.
Data Manipulation
Learn how to manipulate and store data from the API in your application. This includes parsing JSON data and using Go's data structures (like structs, slices, and maps).


Step 2 Learn Go Programming Language


Go Basics
Start with the fundamentals of Go variables, data types, control structures (if statements, loops), functions, and error handling.

Go HTTP Package
Learn how to create a web server using the net-http package.
Understand how to handle incoming requests and send responses back to clients.
JSON Handling
Get comfortable with encoding and decoding JSON in Go using the encoding json package.
Practice reading JSON data from the API and converting it into Go structs.


Step 3 Frontend Development

JavaScript Basics
Understand JavaScript for adding interactivity to your web pages.
Learn about DOM manipulation to respond to user actions (like clicks or key presses).


Step 4 Implementing Client-Server Communication
AJAX Requests
Learn how to make asynchronous requests from the client side to your Go server using JavaScript (e.g., using fetch or XMLHttpRequest).
Understand how to handle responses from the server and update the UI accordingly.
Event Handling
Implement event listeners in JavaScript to trigger actions based on user interactions (e.g., clicking a button).
Ensure that these events call your server endpoints to fetch or send data.


Step 5 Testing and Error Handling
Unit Testing in Go
Learn how to write unit tests for your Go functions using the testing package.
Ensure that your API endpoints are tested for expected behavior.
Error Handling
Implement proper error handling in both your Go server and JavaScript code to manage unexpected situations gracefully.


Step 6 Deployment
Hosting Your Application
Research options for hosting your Go application (e.g., Heroku, DigitalOcean).
Understand how to set up a domain name if needed.
